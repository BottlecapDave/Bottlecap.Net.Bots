This is a generic interface/library for creating skills for bots once, but distribute to many endpoints (e.g. Alexa skills)

Currently, the library supports
* Alexa

But more may be added in the future.

This was originally built for my published Alexa Skills so that I built my skills in a platform agnostic way.
